**Objective**: Implement a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy to purchase a cryptocurrency systematically over time using Uniswap and price data from CoinMarketCap.

**Steps**:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Define the following parameters:
     - Wallet address (required): Address used for transactions.
     - Private key (required): Private key to sign transactions.
     - Token to buy (e.g., ETH) (required): The target cryptocurrency to purchase.
     - Base token (e.g., USDC) (required): The token used for payment.
     - Total investment (required): The total amount to invest over the DCA period.
     - Number of periods (required): The number of times to invest (e.g., weekly).
     - Interval (required): Time interval between purchases (e.g., 7 days in seconds).

2. **Fetch Price Data**:
   - Use CoinMarketCap API to fetch the current price of the target cryptocurrency in USD.
   - Validate that the price data is successfully retrieved.

3. **Calculate Investment per Period**:
   - Divide the total investment by the number of periods:
     \[
     \text{investment per period} = \frac{\text{total investment}}{\text{number of periods}}
     \]
   - Log the calculated investment amount for each period.

4. **Convert Investment to Target Token**:
   - Calculate the amount of target cryptocurrency to purchase in each period:
     \[
     \text{token amount} = \frac{\text{investment per period}}{\text{current price}}
     \]

5. **Fetch Best Swap Rate**:
   - Use a DEX aggregator or Uniswap to fetch the best swap rate for the base token to the target token.
   - Confirm the swap rate is feasible compared to the fetched price.

6. **Perform Token Swap**:
   - Execute the swap using Uniswap with the following parameters:
     - Wallet address
     - Private key
     - Base token (e.g., USDC)
     - Target token (e.g., ETH)
     - Amount in (investment per period in base token)
     - Amount out minimum (calculated minimum based on slippage tolerance)

7. **Log Transaction Details**:
   - Record the following after each swap:
     - Transaction hash
     - Amount of target tokens received
     - Gas fees incurred

8. **Wait for Next Interval**:
   - Pause for the specified interval (e.g., 7 days).
   - Notify the user of the time remaining until the next purchase.

9. **Repeat Until Completion**:
   - Continue the process until the total number of periods is completed.

10. **Generate Summary Report**:
    - Compile a report with the following:
      - Total amount invested.
      - Total tokens purchased.
      - Average price per token.
      - Total gas fees incurred.
    - Present the final summary to the user.

**Dependencies**:
- Tools required:
  - Get_Token_Price_CMC: Fetch token price from CoinMarketCap.
  - Perform_Token_Swap: Execute swaps on Uniswap.
  - Get_Best_Swap_Rate: Retrieve the best swap rate from DEX aggregators.
  - Estimate_Gas_Fee: Estimate transaction gas fees.
  - Ask_Human: Prompt the user for any missing information.
